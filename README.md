:: Strategy Pattern ::
* Encapsulates interchangeable behaviors
* Uses delegation to decide witch one to use
* Changing behaviors out of prent class ; use interface
* Take the parts that vary and encapsulate them ;  you can alter or extend without affecting others
* Keep things flexible
* Change behavior dynamically ; at runtime
* Polymorphism ; the class declaring doesn't have to know about the actual object type
* Favor composition over inheritance ; more flexibility
* Program to a interface, not a implementation
